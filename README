Current progress:
+ Store dictionary with frequencies of all ngrams 2 to 5.
+ Update 5-gram history after every keypress.
+ Find last 4-gram presses and predict next keypress based on 5-gram history.
+ Record the prediction accuracy

In progress:

TODO:
- Generlalize for arbitrary n-gram size.
	- Problem: ngram dictionaries are hard-coded.
- Compare to all ngrams up to size N for predictions.
- Add hotkeys
- Statistical evaluation of how random human keyporesses are.

Fancy features:
- Sample predictions from empiric distribution (binary)
- For final prediction add up all n-gram predictions
- Allow to change n-gram lookup during runtime.


Arbitrary n-gram idea:
+single dictionary with all ngrams up to N.
- keyporess calls register keypress function.
