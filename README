+ Update 5-gram history after every keypress.
+ Find last 4-gram presses and predict next keypress based on 5-gram history.
+ Record the prediction accuracy
+ Generlalize for arbitrary n-gram size.
+ Compare to all ngrams up to size N for predictions.
+ Add hotkeys
+ Statistical evaluation of how random human keyporesses are.

In progress:

TODO:
- Reset button.
+ UI overhaul:

Arbitrary n-gram idea:
+single dictionary with all ngrams up to N.
+ keyporess calls register keypress function.
+ Implement a single container for all n-grams
