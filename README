Current progress:
+ Store dictionary with frequencies of all ngrams 2 to 5.
+ Update 5-gram history after every keypress.
+ Find last 4-gram presses and predict next keypress based on 5-gram history.
+ Record the prediction accuracy
+ Generlalize for arbitrary n-gram size.
+ Compare to all ngrams up to size N for predictions.
+ Add hotkeys

In progress:

TODO:
- Reset button.
- Statistical evaluation of how random human keyporesses are.
- UI overhaul:
	- big buttons
	- ScreenFilling format
	- Prediction history.
		- With colors
	- Option to show/hide next prediction
	- About tab
		- Info about me.
- Beta-binomial plot (will look badass)

Fancy features:
- Sample predictions from empiric distribution (binary)
- For final prediction add up all n-gram predictions
- Allow to change n-gram lookup during runtime.
- Beta-binomial plot


Arbitrary n-gram idea:
+single dictionary with all ngrams up to N.
+ keyporess calls register keypress function.
+ Implement a single container for all n-grams
+ Look up the longest n-1-gram that is equal to current sequence
